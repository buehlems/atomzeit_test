# atomzeit_test
Work in progress.  
##Short description:  ##
Gets the current time, sunset and sunrise from webpages:  
http://www.atomzeit.eu: get all data for Berlin. Adjust sunrise and sunset to Boeblingen by an empiric sinus formula  
http://worldtimeapi.org: get current time and local UTC adjustment  
http://api.sunrise-sunset.org: get sunrise and sunset in UTC and adjust to local time  

util and WiFi_TL are copied from sma_web. I'll clean that up in the future and make them a separate library.
